# RockPaperScissor
Simple Simulation of a Game of Rock Paper Scissor
It emulates a simple Rock Paper Scissor game, wherein the User (henceforth, Player1) plays the game against the Computer (henceforth, Player2).

It consists of the following sections: 
  1. Move enum :: The possible game moves
  2. MatchResult enum :: The possible game results
  3. Player class :: Definition of a player
  4. GameHistory class :: Definition of a simple game log/history 
  5. Game Main body :: Where most of the actions are performed
  
This Python program is written by a beginner (me!). 
As such, the sections listed above have not been segregated into different files.
Edits and code review are welcome.

##As stated in the python program file:
Permission given to refer to the code, modify the code and copy the code for personal usage.
No permissions given for commercial purposes, not that I would expect anyone to do so. The code is fairly generic after all.
